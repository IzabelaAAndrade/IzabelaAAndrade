# Hi there, amazing human being! 🦕
**Long time, no see! What’s popping?**

Well, i’m not sure we’ve been properly introduced! Let me change that. My name is Izabela and i’m from Brazil! I just concluded my high school, as well as an informatics technical course, and I'm about to start a Biomedical Sciences degree at USP.

I’m fascinated by discoveries and love learning new things! I'm passionate about forensics, biomedicine and books :)

## Here's a quote that inspires me 💚

“Small places make for small lives. And some people are fine with that. They like knowing where to put their feet. But if you only walk in other people’s steps, you cannot make your own way. You cannot leave a mark.”  - The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, V.E. Schwab
