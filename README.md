# Hi there, amazing human being! 🦕
**Long time, no see! What’s popping?**

Well, i’m not sure we’ve been properly introduced! Let me change that. My name is Izabela and i’m from Brazil! I just concluded my high school, as well as an informatics technical course, and I'm about to start a Biomedical Sciences course at USP.

I’m fascinated by discoveries and love learning new things! I'm passionate about forensics, biomedicine and books :)

## Here's a quote that inspires me 💚

“A secret kept. A record made. The first mark she left upon the world, long before she knew the truth, that ideas are so much wilder than memories, that they long and look for ways of taking root.” - The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, V.E. Schwab
